## Overview
Through studying combinations of variables and their effects on a virtual car's performance, we aimed to optimize a model's accuracy and speed through several timed trials. We explored the reinforcement learning technique of <em>pre-training</em>, in which models are cloned from previous models, essentially retaining the training experience that that previous model received. These new models also incorporate new reward functions, and by exploring the relationship between each source of training, we endeavored to study the iterative development of consecutive models.

## Built with
Python, Jupyter Notebooks
Log analysis files were developed using a template provided by Amazon Web Services, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepracer-workshops">here</a>.
