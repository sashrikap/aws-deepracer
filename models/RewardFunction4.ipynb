    "Key Elements:\n",
    "1. Split the track into pieces consisting of straight and curved parts of the track, then used the waypoints plotted to determine the average, max, and minimum values on that section of the track\n",
    "2. Based on the different values in each section of the track, we decided to change the value used to determine curvature of track\n",
    "3. Changing the value to determine curvature of a track to 0.97\n",
    "4. If value calculated by math function > 0.97, track is straight, and otherwise, it is curved\n",
    "5. Factoring in steering, giving curved tracks a bit more leeway \n",
